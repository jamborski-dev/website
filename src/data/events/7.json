      "description": "In a world racing toward AI dominance, there’s one thing the machines can't replicate: the boundless spark of human creativity. Join me for a deep dive into why \"intelligent\" AI still can't outthink human imagination - and how developers and innovators have always thrived by embracing the unknown. We'll expose real-world AI slip-ups, revisit times we thought technology might replace us (spoiler alert - it didn't), and reveal how your personal spark remains the ultimate edge in any AI-driven future."

We'll explore industry expectations, and unpack emerging norms around transparency, value-based pricing, human oversight and client consent in AI-augmented work."
